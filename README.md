# OpenCode for Financial Services

Reference agents, skills, commands, and data connectors for investment banking, equity research, private equity, wealth management, and fund administration — built for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nothing in this repository constitutes investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice. These agents draft analyst work product — models, memos, research notes, reconciliations — for review by a qualified professional. They do not make investment recommendations, execute transactions, bind risk, post to a ledger, or approve onboarding; every output is staged for human sign-off. You are responsible for verifying outputs and for compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to your firm.

## Repository Structure

```
.opencode/
├── agents/        # 10 primary agents + 30 subagent workers
├── commands/      # 47 slash commands (/dcf, /comps, /earnings, …)

opencode.json      # MCP servers, global permissions, agent registry
AGENTS.md          # Development workflow + agent reference
```

Everything is file-based — markdown and JSON. No build step.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed
- API keys for any MCP data providers you plan to use

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services.git
cd financial-services

# OpenCode discovers .opencode/ automatically
# Agents appear in the TUI when you switch agent mode
# Skills load automatically when their trigger conditions match
# Commands are available as /command-name
```

Once inside the repo, OpenCode automatically discovers:
- **Agents** — switch to `pitch-agent`, `gl-reconciler`, `market-researcher`, etc. from the agent picker
- **Skills** — fire automatically when relevant (e.g., asking for a DCF triggers `dcf-model`)
- **Commands** — use `/dcf`, `/comps`, `/earnings`, `/ic-memo`, and 43 more slash commands

### MCP Data Providers

Configure API keys for the providers you use. OpenCode reads `opencode.json` for server URLs; set credentials in your global OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) or via environment variables.

## Agents

Each agent is a named workflow with depth-1 subagent workers. They produce staged work product for human review — they do not publish, post, or approve.

| Function | Agent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage & Advisory** | `pitch-agent` | Comps, precedents, LBO → branded pitch deck, end to end |
| | `meeting-prep-agent` | Briefing pack before every client meeting |
| **Research & Modeling** | `market-researcher` | Sector primer → industry overview, competitive landscape, peer comps, ideas shortlist |
| | `earnings-reviewer` | Earnings call + filings → model update → note draft |
| | `model-builder` | DCF, LBO, 3-statement, comps — live in Excel |
| **Fund Admin & Finance Ops** | `valuation-reviewer` | Ingests GP packages, runs valuation template, stages LP reporting |
| | `gl-reconciler` | GL ↔ subledger reconciliation — finds breaks, traces root cause, routes for sign-off |
| | `month-end-closer` | Accruals, roll-forwards, variance commentary |
| | `statement-auditor` | Audits pre-generated LP statements before distribution |
| **Operations** | `kyc-screener` | Parses onboarding docs, runs KYC/AML rules engine, flags gaps |

Each primary agent is backed by 3 subagent workers following a security isolation pattern:
- **Reader** — reads untrusted documents, returns structured data only
- **Processor** — analyzes data against trusted MCP sources, read-only
- **Writer** — the only worker with edit permission, produces final output files

## MCP Integrations

All data connectors are configured in `opencode.json`:

| Provider | URL |
|---|---|
| [Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/) | `https://mcp.daloopa.com/server/mcp` |
| [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/) | `https://mcp.morningstar.com/mcp` |
| [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/) | `https://kfinance.kensho.com/integrations/mcp` |

| [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) | `https://api.moodys.com/genai-ready-data/m1/mcp` |
| [MT Newswires](https://www.mtnewswires.com/) | `https://vast-mcp.blueskyapi.com/mtnewswires` |

MCP access may require a subscription or API key from the provider. Deployment-specific servers (internal GL, subledger, CRM, screening, NAV, portfolio) use env-var URLs — configure those in your global OpenCode config.

## Making It Yours

These are reference templates — they get better when you tune them to how your firm works.

- **Swap connectors** — edit `opencode.json` to point at your data providers and internal systems.
- **Add firm context** — drop your terminology, processes, and formatting standards into skill files.
- **Bring your templates** — `/ppt-template` teaches OpenCode your branded PowerPoint layouts.
- **Adjust agent scope** — edit `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` to match how your team runs the workflow.
- **Add your own** — follow the existing pattern: agent `.md` in `agents/`, commands in `commands/`, skills in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Contributing

Everything is markdown and JSON. Fork, edit, PR.

- **Agents** — edit `.opencode/agents/<name>.md`
- **Skills** — edit `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Commands** — edit `.opencode/commands/<name>.md`
- **MCP servers** — edit `opencode.json`
